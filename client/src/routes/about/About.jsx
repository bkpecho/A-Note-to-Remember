      <h1>About &quot;A Note to Remember&quot; App</h1>
      <p>
        &quot;A Note to Remember&quot; is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express,
        React, Node.js) application developed to help users keep track of their
        notes and important tasks efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app uses React for the frontend, providing a smooth and responsive
        user experience. React Router is used for handling navigation, allowing
        users to move between the home and about pages seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the backend, the app utilizes Node.js and Express to handle
        server-side operations. MongoDB serves as the database, storing
        users&apos; notes securely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combination of these technologies makes &quot;A Note to
        Remember&quot; a powerful and user-friendly application that can be used
        to organize and manage notes effectively.
