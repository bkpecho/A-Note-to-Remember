### Setting Up Local Environment

**Frontend Environment Variable**

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend root directory.
2. Add the following line to the `.env.local` file, replacing the URL with your backend server address:

   ```
   VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

**Backend Environment Variable**

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend root directory.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholder in the MongoDB URI with your actual MongoDB cluster information:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@your-mongodb-cluster-here/Note
   ```

**Important**: Remember not to commit the `.env.local` and `.env` files to the public repository to keep sensitive information secure.

## Project Status and Future Improvements

A Note to Remember is currently a barebone implementation, serving as a functional starting point for a Note-taking app. While it provides essential features for managing notes, there are still numerous opportunities for enhancements and additional functionalities.
